# Interactive Brooks' Cucumber Logic üçΩÔ∏èü•í

This project is a simple interactive web simulation that demonstrates Brooks' cucumber logic. The user (Mom) can give Brooks cucumber bits, and Brooks will either spit them onto the table and throw them on the floor or directly spit them onto the floor depending on whether Mom has intervened with a rule.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Control the scenario by giving cucumber bits to Brooks or declaring a rule.
- **Box Score**: Displays the count of cucumber bits on the table and the floor, with color changes based on rule compliance.
- **Dynamic Log**: A running log that updates in real-time as Brooks follows or works around the rule.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click **Give Brooks a Cucumber Bit ü•í** to simulate Brooks receiving cucumber bits. Initially, he will spit the bits onto the table and throw them onto the floor.
3. Click **Mom Declares the Rule üö´** to change the scenario. After the rule is declared, Brooks will directly spit the cucumber bits onto the floor.
