# Brooks' Cucumber Logic ü•íüçΩÔ∏è

This project is a simple interactive web simulation that demonstrates Brooks' cucumber logic. The user (Mom) can give Brooks cucumber bits, and Brooks will either spit them onto the table and throw them on the floor or directly spit them onto the floor depending on whether Mom has intervened with a rule.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Control the scenario by giving cucumber bits to Brooks or declaring a rule.
- **Box Score**: Displays the count of cucumber bits on the table and the floor, with color changes based on rule compliance.
- **Dynamic Log**: A running log that updates in real-time as Brooks follows or works around the rule.

## File Structure

- `brooks.html`: The main HTML file.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the project, including button and box score design.
- `script.js`: Handles Brooks' logic and interaction with the DOM.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `brooks.html` in a modern web browser (no server setup required).
3. Use the buttons to interact with Brooks and observe the outcomes.

## How to Play

1. Click **"Give Brooks a Cucumber Bit ü•í"** to see Brooks' actions.
2. Click **"Mom Declares the Rule üö´"** to intervene.
3. Watch how Brooks responds and check the box score for updates!
